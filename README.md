It is provided with authentication to the user and also has a purchasing possibility linked to the users' their account. It is created with HTML, CSS and JS with the React framework.

## Why did I create this application?

This is my first React app created for practicing purposes. I built this app by coding along with a React instructor to teach myself how the React framework works. It improved my Javascript skills and taught me how to work with React Router, Redux and React Hooks. Also, it showed how to use Firebase as a back-end to host my own web application. The CSS code was provided.
